# Victron BLE to MQTT Integration

This repository provides working examples and templates for integrating Victron Smart devices (e.g., MPPTs, SmartShunts) using [victron-ble2mqtt](https://github.com/Louisvdw/victron-ble2mqtt). These examples allow for forwarding Victron data to your platform of choice such as Home Assistant, Node-RED, or others.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility and Scope

* Confirmed working with but not limited to, Victron 75/15 MPPTs, Victron SmartShunt, and Venus OS running on Raspberry Pi.
* Current integrations include:

  * Home Assistant (via MQTT dashboard)
  * Node-RED (via MQTT flow)
  * Refoss Smart Energy Monitor (via native Home Assistant integration)

## üìÅ Dashboard Directory

All dashboard files are located under the `dashboards/` folder.

## üß© Dashboard JSON Files

### Home Assistant

* **Path:** `dashboards/home_assistant_mqtt.json`
* **Description:** Imports into Home Assistant's MQTT dashboard to visualize Victron Smart device data.
* üìù *Comment inside JSON marks where to replace MAC address.*

### Node-RED

* **Path:** `dashboards/nodered_victron_flow.json`
* **Description:** Full Node-RED flow to subscribe to Victron MQTT topics and build your own dashboard or automations.

> Replace MAC addresses or topic filters as needed inside these files. Look for comment markers `# REPLACE_ME`.

## üîß Setup



üìÑ **Installation Guide:** [Victron BLE to MQTT Integration Setup Guide](https://github.com/curtalfrey/victron-ble2mqtt-integration/blob/main/Victron_BLE_to_MQTT_Integration_Setup_Guide.md)





### Step 1: Clone This Repo

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/curtalfrey/victron-ble2mqtt-integration.git
cd victron-ble2mqtt-integration
```

### Step 2: Edit `user_settings.py`


## Configuration

To get started, copy the example user settings file and customize it for your setup:

```bash
cp setup/user_settings.example.py victron_ble2mqtt/user_settings.py
```


```bash
change the name to below and 
nano user_settings.py
```

Make sure to:

* Replace MAC addresses with your actual Victron device MACs
* Modify MQTT settings if needed

### Step 3: Configure `victron_ble2mqtt.service`

```bash
sudo cp setup/victron_ble2mqtt.service /etc/systemd/system/victron_ble2mqtt.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable victron_ble2mqtt.service
sudo systemctl start victron_ble2mqtt.service
```

### Step 4: Import Dashboards

* For Home Assistant, use the GUI to import `home_assistant_mqtt.json`
* For Node-RED, open the Node-RED UI and import `nodered_victron_flow.json` via the editor

## ‚úÖ Fix for Common `user_settings.toml` Error

If `user_settings.toml` is not being loaded or is causing errors, skip it completely and use `user_settings.py`. This repo provides a verified working `user_settings.py` that eliminates TOML-related issues.

## üîå Refoss Smart Energy Monitor Integration

**Supported models:**

* Refoss Smart Energy Monitor EM06 (firmware v2.3.8+)
* Refoss Smart Energy Monitor EM16 (firmware v3.1.7+)

**Integration steps:**

1. Ensure the Refoss device is on the same LAN as your Home Assistant instance.
2. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration ‚Üí Refoss**.
3. Home Assistant will auto-discover the device and create energy monitoring entities (e.g., current, voltage, power per channel).
4. These entities can be used in dashboards and automations, combined with Victron data.

> üìù Refoss integration is entirely local and does not rely on cloud services.

üß≠ Dashboards & Example Flows
This project includes example dashboards for Home Assistant and Node-RED to help you quickly visualize and use MQTT data published by victron-ble2mqtt.

üìÅ Location:
All example files are in the dashboards/ directory.

üü¶ Home Assistant
File: home_assistant_victron.json
Description: A sample Lovelace dashboard showing Victron SmartShunt and MPPT data via MQTT.
Usage:

Go to Home Assistant > Settings > Dashboards > Raw Config Editor

Import the JSON, then replace any example MQTT topics, MACs, or entity IDs with your own

üü® Node-RED
1. example_nodered_victron_flow.json
Uses victron/# topic filter

Good for general Victron MQTT data testing

Broker address is set to YOUR_MQTT_BROKER_IP (replace with yours)

2. example_homeassistant_flow.json
Uses homeassistant/# topic filter

Best for visualizing MQTT messages published by Home Assistant‚Äôs auto-discovery

Also includes YOUR_MQTT_BROKER_IP placeholder

To import:
In Node-RED, click the menu (‚ò∞) ‚Üí Import ‚Üí paste JSON or upload the file.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
These files are examples only ‚Äî be sure to update:

broker IP address

MQTT topics

Any MAC addresses or device-specific filters

Avoid importing multiple flows with the same Node IDs; Node-RED will automatically fix conflicts if they arise.
